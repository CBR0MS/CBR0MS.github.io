## A Tool for Quick, Actionable Web-based EyeÂ Tracking

Despite providing a potentially compelling source of user feedback, eye tracking has yet to become a staple of the UX designer's toolkit for a number of practical reasons including high cost and complexity. By dematerializing the eye tracking procedure and inserting it earlier in the design process, an easily distributed, low cost tool aimed at providing fast insight into user intention is born.

I worked on developing this project in summer 2020. More details and the full case study are upcoming.
